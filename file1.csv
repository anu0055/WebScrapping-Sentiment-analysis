The financial sector reclaimed its position as the No. 1 wealth creator while public sector undertakings recorded their worst performance in 2016-21, the Motilal Oswal 26th Annual Wealth Creation Study showed. The financial sector was both the top wealth creating and top wealth destroying sector.  Equity was the biggest wealth creating asset class of the year as stock markets the world over created history by reaching record highs. The market-capitalisation of most companies and benchmark indices skyrocketed, first-time investors got attracted to the stock markets, and unprecedented liquidity was available in the market.  Adani Transmission emerged as the fastest wealth creator and Adani Enterprises the best all-round wealth creator.  Motilal Oswal found that the Top 100 companies in India&rsquo;s equity markets created Rs 71 lakh crore in wealth during the five years from 2016 to 2021. This was the highest wealth created in the past 26 five-year periods. The pace of wealth creation was also robust at a compound annual growth rate of 24 percent vis-&agrave;-vis 14 percent for the BSE Sensex.  The previous best period in terms of wealth creation was 2014-19, when the markets generated Rs 49 lakh crore of wealth for investors. The five-year period of 2015-20 was impacted by the pandemic and created Rs 21 lakh crore of investor wealth.  The Motilal Oswal 26th Annual Wealth Creation Study, 2021, was released on December 15. The firm&rsquo;s wealth creation study was commissioned by Raamdeo Agrawal, chairman of Motilal Oswal Group.  Reliance rules the roost  Reliance Industries, the largest Indian company by market capitalisation, smashed all records to emerge as the largest wealth creator for the third time in a row. It added Rs 9.7 lakh crore to investor wealth, beating its own previous record of Rs 5.6 lakh crore during 2014-19. The company accounted for 13.6 percent of the total wealth created during the period.  &ldquo;Reliance&rsquo;s re-emergence as the biggest wealth creator reflects the power of phygital &ndash; physical plus digital,&rdquo; Motilal Oswal said in the report. &ldquo;Its oil-to-chemicals and retail businesses are strongly rooted in the physical whereas the telecom business is the digital dimension. Going forward, expect more and more phygital and digital companies to spearhead wealth creation.&rdquo;  IT giant&nbsp;Tata Consulting Services&nbsp;came in second by creating wealth of Rs 7.3 lakh crore, followed by&nbsp;HDFC Bank,&nbsp;which added Rs 5.2 lakh crore,&nbsp;Hindustan Unilever&nbsp;Rs 3.4 lakh crore and Infosys Rs 3.3 lakh crore.  Bajaj Finance,&nbsp;ICICI Bank,&nbsp;HDFC,&nbsp;Kotak Mahindra Bank&nbsp;and&nbsp;HCL Technologies&nbsp;made up the remaining top 10 wealth creators for 2016-21.  Reliance also made its entry into the list of top 10 fastest wealth creators, an area which is ruled predominantly by mid and small cap companies.  Adani Group &ndash; fastest in the race  The study found Adani Transmission&nbsp;was the fastest wealth creator with a price CAGR of 93 percent during 2016-21. Another Adani Group company &ndash;&nbsp;Adani Enterprises&nbsp;&ndash; was ranked the third fastest wealth creator with a price CAGR of 86 percent, behind&nbsp;Deepak Nitrite,&nbsp;which had a price CAGR of 90 percent.  Tanla Platforms&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ruchi Soya&nbsp;were the other two companies in the top five fastest wealth creators.  A sum of Rs 10 lakh invested equally in 2016 among the top 10 fastest wealth creators would have grown to Rs 170 lakh in 2021, which is a CAGR of 77 percent compared with 14 percent for the Sensex, according to the study.  &ldquo;For high wealth creation, it is essential to pick small-to-mid companies with robust earnings growth prospects trading at reasonable valuations,&rdquo; the study highlighted.  Adani Enterprises also emerged as the most consistent wealth creator in the past five years with the highest price CAGR of 86 percent.  Sectoral Participation  The financial sector emerged as the biggest wealth creating sector during 2016-21 by generating Rs 17.4 lakh crore. The sector lost its numero uno position last year to consumer &amp;amp;amp; retail, which came in at third position this year with Rs 12.5 lakh crore. Technology occupied the second position by adding Rs 15.2 lakh crore.  Oil &amp;amp;amp; gas and metals &amp;amp;amp; mining made up the remaining list of top five biggest wealth creating sectors.  Led by rapid adoption of cloud, transformation and digitisation, the technology sector is witnessing robust demand and a strong deal pipeline, which will lead to high growth for the sector.  &ldquo;It is the only sector which may potentially challenge the dominance of the financial sector in the next wealth creation study period, 2017-2022,&rdquo; Motilal Oswal said.  PSUs lose the plot  Public sector undertakings (PSUs) came up with their worst performance in the wealth creation process in 2016-21. Only Gujarat Gas&nbsp;and&nbsp;Indraprastha Gas could make it to the top 100 wealth creators, generating less than 1 percent of the total wealth.  The previous period of 2015-20, there were seven PSUs in the top 100, with 3 percent of the total wealth created. The study also found out that there were five PSUs in the top 10 wealth destroying companies. Private banks were the top wealth creators while public sector banks made up the top wealth destroyers.  Digital &ndash; the way to go  The wealth creation report highlighted that digital will be the mantra of the future.  &ldquo;Globally, value is migrating from atoms (businesses dealing in physical matter) to bits (businesses that are digital in nature),&rdquo; the report said. &ldquo;This has already played out in a big way in the US.&rdquo;  The digital ecosystem in India is right for atoms-to-bits to play out here, it said.  According to the report, bits deal in intangible assets, have very low cost of replicating their products, and benefit from network effects.  &ldquo;As a result, bits can scale up very rapidly compared to their atom counterparts,&rdquo; the report added.  Bits have high initial losses and their success depends on hyper growth, operational scalability, large opportunity size, favourable unit economics, wide distribution and network effects.

The retail business saw strong recovery and performed well.,"Reliance Industries' (RIL) September quarter results (Q2FY22) are broadly in line with analysts' estimates, and have even outperformed on some parameters. The company&rsquo;s consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) increased by 11 percent vis-&agrave;-vis the June quarter (Q1FY22) to Rs 26,020 crore. This represents a 37 percent year-on-year (YoY) EBITDA growth.  Analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a report on October 22, &ldquo;RIL's Q2 EBITDA was in line with Jefferies estimates (JEFe) on beat in Retail, in line O2C and miss in Jio.&rdquo; O2C refers to RIL&rsquo;s oil-to-chemical segments.  The broker further added, &ldquo;EBITDA was up 11 percent quarter-on-quarter with Jio 1&nbsp;percent below JEFe, Reliance Retail (RR) 6&nbsp;percent ahead of JEFe and O2C in line with JEFe.&rdquo;  With the restrictions easing after the second covid-19 wave, the retail business saw a strong recovery. RIL&rsquo;s Q2 retail revenues have surpassed pre-pandemic levels. Core retail revenue growth stood at 16 percent YoY. The business saw a meaningful improvement in store operating hours to 89 percent in September versus 38 percent in June.  Footfalls have recovered to 78 percent of pre-pandemic levels compared to 46 percent in Q1. The company saw strong growth in fashion &amp;amp;amp; lifestyle with record quarterly sales in apparel &amp;amp;amp; footwear category. New stores added in Q2 stood at 813, which is far higher than 123 stores added in Q1.  On the other hand, Reliance Jio&rsquo;s performance was a tad underwhelming. The firm saw a churn of low-end subscribers owing to the pandemic&rsquo;s impact, driving a net decline of 11.1 million in customer base in Q2. &ldquo;A repeat of Jio's Q2 subscriber performance in Q3 will definitely dampen hopes of a tariff hike over the next few quarters.  For now, we will closely watch the JioPhone Next launch and its impact on Jio's net subscriber additions,&rdquo; said Jefferies&rsquo; analysts in another report. To an extent, better ARPU (average revenue per user) compensated for the subscriber performance. In Q2, ARPU stood at Rs 143.6 per subscriber per month, representing a 3.7 percent growth over previous quarter.  Centrum Broking Ltd analysts said in their first cut note, &ldquo;Retail and Telecom now forms approx. 48 percent of consolidated EBITDA versus around 32/40 percent in FY20/21. With the continued reopening across the country from June driving a strong return to normalcy H2FY22 will see much stronger numbers from both these segments, in our opinion.&rdquo;  Meanwhile, RIL&rsquo;s O2C business performance was decent last quarter. Revenues grew 58 percent YoY mainly on account of better realizations driven by the increase in oil prices and higher volumes. O2C EBITDA increased by around 44 percent year-on-year and 4 percent sequentially.  Overall, RIL&rsquo;s profit after tax (PAT) in Q2 increased by 46 percent YoY and 12 percent quarter-on-quarter. Centrum Broking&rsquo;s analysts said, &ldquo;RIL adjusted consolidated EBITDA/ PAT at Rs 26000 crore/ Rs 15500 crore, beat Centrum&rsquo;s estimated EBITDA/ PAT of Rs24800 crore/ 14600 crore as retail revived strongly with higher margins (retail EBIT +66&nbsp;percent quarter-on-quarter).&rdquo;  Ahead of the results announcement on Friday, the RIL stock closed marginally higher at Rs 2,627.40 per share on the National Stock Exchange. Some analysts expect the growth outlook to be strong. JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd expects a strong free cash flow generation phase with major capex completed and strong 17-18&nbsp;percent earnings per share CAGR likely over the next three-five years. CAGR is the compound annual growth rate.  Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

All businesses&nbsp;recorded growth over pre-Covid levels with the digital services segment having a record quarterly business in Q2.  Profit in the year-ago period was at Rs 10,602 crore and Rs 13,806 crore in June 2021 quarter. The sequential growth in profit was 12.1 percent.  Consolidated revenue for the quarter came in at Rs&nbsp;1.74 lakh crore, significantly higher by 49.8 percent compared to Rs 1.16&nbsp;lakh crore reported in the year-ago period, said Reliance Industries in its BSE filing, adding the topline growth on a sequential basis was 20.6 percent.  &amp;quot;Reliance has posted a strong performance in Q2FY22. This demonstrates the inherent strengths of our businesses and the robust recovery of the Indian and global economies. All businesses reflect growth over pre-Covid levels,&amp;quot; said Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani in a statement.  He further said the operational and financial performance reflected a sharp recovery in the retail segment and sustained growth in oil-to-chemicals (O2C) and digital services business.  &amp;quot;O2C business benefited from sharp recovery in demand across products and higher transportation fuel margins. Reliance Retail continues to grow on the back of rapid expansion of both physical stores and digital offerings resulting in healthy growth in revenues and margin expansion,&amp;quot; Ambani added.  He said Jio, the digital services business, continued to transform the broadband market in India and set new benchmarks for the industry.  The standalone profit of the company grew by 44.1 percent to Rs 9,228 crore and gross revenue increased by 68.8 percent to Rs 1.08 lakh crore YoY in Q2.  The operating performance was also strong during the quarter, with record consolidated EBITDA at Rs 30,283 crore for the quarter, growing 30 percent YoY.  Jio Platforms  The telecom business reported quarterly operating revenue at Rs 19,777 crore, a growth of 15.1 percent YoY (adjusted for interconnection usage charge&nbsp;or IUC), driven by continued subscriber traction in the connectivity business, with&nbsp;average revenue per user (ARPU) at Rs 143.6 per subscriber per month, which is a healthy 3.7 percent growth over previous quarter.  Jio, which continued to hold the top position in 4G coverage and availability, had a customer base of 429.5 million at the end of September 2021, a net addition of 23.8 million customers YoY.  Its net profit grew by&nbsp;a massive 23.5&nbsp;percent YoY to Rs 3,728 crore and EBITDA increased by 16.6 percent to Rs 9,294 crore in the quarter ended September 2021.  Retail Business  Reliance Retail&nbsp;delivered strong performance with revenue from operations growing 9.2 percent year-on-year to Rs 39,926 crore in September 2021 quarter which saw robust growth across all consumption baskets led by strong revival in consumer&nbsp;sentiments amid festivities, relaxations in Covid related curbs and vaccinations.  &amp;quot;The business re-established growth momentum in fashion &amp;amp;amp; lifestyle with sales closing above pre-Covid levels. Consumer electronics and grocery maintained strong growth momentum,&amp;quot; the company said.  Retail business profit for the quarter at Rs 1,695 crore grew by 74.2 percent, with&nbsp;EBIDTA growth of 45.2 percent YoY at Rs 2,913 crore, driven by favourable revenue mix, and continued focus on cost management and investment income, said the company, adding&nbsp;EBITDA margin expanded by 180 bps&nbsp;YoY driven by strong operating leverage.  Oil-To-Chemicals Business  The O2C business sustained growth momentum, registering a&nbsp;58.1 percent year-on-year growth in revenue at Rs 1.2 lakh crore&nbsp;primarily due to improved realisation on the back of increase in oil prices and higher volumes.&nbsp;Refinery throughput increased by 11.8 percent YoY to 17.1 MMT (million metric tonnes)&nbsp;during the quarter.  Crude prices were lifted higher by tighter supply amid multiple production outages, lowering in uptick&nbsp;of Covid infections and higher overall throughput.&nbsp;Brent crude averaged $73.5&nbsp;a barrel in Q2FY22, up by $4.6&nbsp;QoQ and&nbsp;$30.5 YoY).  Reliance said O2C business EBITDA improved by 43.9 percent YoY to&nbsp;Rs&nbsp;12,720 crore primarily on account of better transportation fuel cracks, higher intermediates product deltas, efficient product placement and yield management. However, &amp;quot;EBITDA margin for the quarter declined by 100bps YoY to 10.6 percent due to base effect driven by higher feedstock and product prices,&amp;quot; it noted.  Solar Energy Business  Reliance Industries has increased its focus on solar energy segment as it is going to establish and enable up to 100 GW of solar energy in India by 2030, and become a global player in the renewable industry.  &amp;quot;We continue to make steady progress in accelerating foray into new energy and new materials business. Our partnership approach and the desire to bring India to the forefront of global transition to clean and green transition is underscored by recent investments in some of the best companies in the world in the solar and green energy space,&amp;quot; Ambani said.  &amp;quot;I am now even more confident of achieving ambitious target of Net Carbon Zero by 2035,&amp;quot; he added.  Recently its subsidiary Reliance New Energy Solar (RNESL) acquired 86,887 series C preferred shares of Germany's NexWafe GmbH at a price of EUR 287.73 per share for 25 million euros. NexWafe is developing and producing monocrystalline silicon wafers.

The Reliance stock price hit a record high of Rs 2,750 on the BSE on October 19, with a market capitalisation of almost Rs 18.3 lakh crore. The stock had a strong run-up recently after the company signed several deals in the solar energy business. It has gained 24 percent since the beginning of July.  The September quarter earnings, to be declared on October 22, will likely decide the direction of the stock price.  Experts said Reliance&rsquo;s retail and digital businesses, which accounted for 32.4 percent and 18.5 percent of total revenue, respectively, could be the stars in the September quarter, driving double-digit growth in every earnings parameter.  &ldquo;Retail and digital business will post a strong recovery,&rdquo; Motilal Oswal said in its earnings preview. The brokerage, which has a &lsquo;buy&rsquo; call on the stock, expects consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) growth of 24 percent YoY, driven by the retail and digital businesses, and revenue growth of 34 percent YoY.  Motilal Oswal expects the oil-to-chemical segment&rsquo;s EBITDA to grow by 39 percent, Reliance Jio&rsquo;s EBITDA to increase by 21 percent, and retail EBITDA to grow by 38 percent from a year earlier.  Yes Securities expects&nbsp;Reliance to report better earnings (QoQ and YoY) on improved retail profitability and refinery margins.  The benchmark Singapore gross refining margin (GRM) was at $3.7 a barrel, the highest in the past seven quarters, improving further QoQ in Q2 of FY22, led by better gasoline, aviation turbine fuel and naphtha cracks amid hurricane-led supply disruptions, said Motilal Oswal. GRM is a measure of&nbsp;the amount that refiners earn from turning each barrel of crude oil into fuel products.  Brent crude prices averaged $73 a barrel in Q2, a jump of about 70 percent YoY and 6 percent QoQ, due to supply-side disruptions and inventory shortages. This despite OPEC+ easing production cuts starting in August. Recent hurricanes in the US have taken out more than 25 million barrels of offshore production, said Motilal Oswal.  Brent prices have been increasing and crossed $86 a barrel on October 21 for the first time since October 2018. The rally in prices is largely because of expectations of strong global growth, power outages mainly in China, and supply concerns.  Kotak, too, expects strong earnings growth at Reliance for the quarter, with consolidated profit rising 38.3 percent, EBITDA up 35.1 percent and revenue increasing 32.1 percent YoY.

","Shareholders of Reliance Industries have approved the appointment of Saudi Aramco Chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan on the company board, with less than 2 per cent of votes cast against the proposal.  Disclosing the results of shareholder votes on the appointment, Reliance in a regulatory filing said 98.03 per cent of votes were cast in favour of the resolution to appoint Al-Rumayyan for three years.  As many as 10.89 crore shares or 1.96 per cent voted against the resolution, while 3.23 crore votes were declared invalid due to lack of proper authorisation, it said.  The California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS), a shareholder of Reliance, had last month decided to vote against the move based on US proxy advisory research firm Glass Lewis' recommendation.  CalSTRS decided to oppose the appointment due to Al-Rumayyan's position in Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) as its governor, as well as in Aramco.  PIF has already invested Rs 9,555 crore in Reliance Retail and Rs 11,367 crore in RIL's Jio Platforms. Also, Aramco is in talks to buy a 20 per cent stake in Reliance's oil-to-chemical business.  Reliance had, however, rejected conflict of interest allegations saying, &amp;quot;The appointment of Yasir Al Rumayyan has no connection with the contemplated transaction with Saudi Aramco&amp;quot;.  The O2C business of RIL is being spun off to a subsidiary.  &amp;quot;As per the terms of the proposed transaction, Saudi Aramco will participate in the equity of the O2C subsidiary. The O2C subsidiary board may have nominees of Saudi Aramco to protect its interest,&amp;quot; it added.  As of June 30, 2020, CalSTRS held 5.3 million fully and partly paid shares of RIL, according to its website. CalSTRS is America's second-largest public pension fund with assets totalling approximately USD 318.4 billion as of August 31, 2021.  CalSTRS's opposition was based on a report by Glass, Lewis &amp;amp;amp; Co, an American proxy advisory services company. According to Glass, Lewis &amp;amp;amp; Co, since Al-Rumayyan has a key role in the operations of Aramco and PIF, he does not qualify to be an independent director.  Under Indian law, an independent director cannot have a role in any company that has a business or equity partnership with the firm that intends to appoint him or her.

Of these, more than 50 have already begun including Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics, an initiative of Geneva-based WEF, in their mainstream financial and regulatory reporting. These include PayPal, PwC, Petronas, S&amp;amp;amp;P, Salesforce, Total and Yara International.  The 'stakeholder capitalism metrics' initiative of the WEF, which describes itself as an international organisation for public-private cooperation, seeks to improve the ways that companies measure and demonstrate their performance against ESG (environmental, social and governance) indicators and to enable positive contributions towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  The project's twin objectives are to accelerate convergence among the leading private ESG standard-setters and to bring greater comparability and consistency to the reporting of ESG disclosures.  During its ongoing Sustainable Development Impact Summit, the WEF said that the international support is growing for the stakeholding capitalism metrics initiative with more than 50 companies having begun reporting these metrics in their 2020-2021 filings, while over 100 have shown support for this initiative so far.  The summit brings together global leaders from business, government, and civil society under the theme 'Shaping an Equitable, Inclusive and Sustainable Recovery'.  Those having committed to such reporting include Accenture, Allianz, Bank of America, Dell, Deloitte, EY, HEINEKEN, IBM, Mahindra Group, Mastercard, Nasdaq, Nestle, Reliance Industries, UBS, Unilever and Wipro.  Drawn from existing standards, the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics provide a set of metrics that can be reported on by all companies, regardless of industry or region, the WEF said.  The metrics also offer comparability, which is particularly important for informing ongoing efforts to create a systemic, globally accepted set of common standards for reporting on sustainability performance.  &amp;quot;We are delighted to see so many companies joining this effort and, even more so, excited to see many already implementing the metrics into their reporting,&amp;quot; WEF Managing Director Olivier Schwab said.  &amp;quot;This is the first time we have publicly seen this breadth of data from global companies across sectors on ESG factors. The Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics are already demonstrating that consistent and comparable ESG reporting can help articulate to stakeholders the collective contribution of ESG commitments,&amp;quot; Schwab added.  An early analysis of reports already incorporating the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics in mainstream reporting demonstrates that it is now easier to consistently measure individual company progress against critical ESG areas, as well as the collective impact of those companies committed to reporting the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics.  An initial analysis of the first 45 reports from companies shows how companies are building skills for the future, with over USD 1.5 trillion invested in training.  They also indicate that companies are innovating for better products and services, with over USD 20 trillion spent on R&amp;amp;amp;D and USD 23 trillion in cumulative multi-year innovation investments. They are also contributing to their communities and social vitality with nearly USD 140 trillion in taxes.  The WEF said companies have also faced some challenges reporting on the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics. These include data accessibility, jurisdictional challenges and data-processing capabilities.  Despite these challenges, corporate support for ESG reporting and the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics initiative continues to grow and the Forum will continue to invite all of its partners to join this initiative, it added.

Bhupender Yadav ji,&nbsp; Hon&rsquo;ble Minister of Power and New &amp;amp;amp; Renewable Energy Shri Raj Kumar Singh ji, Hon&rsquo;ble Minister of Science and Technology Shri Jitendra Singh ji,&nbsp; Member Energy NITI Aayog Dr. V K Saraswat,&nbsp; Former Executive Director International Energy Agency, Mr. Nobuo Tanaka Chairman Greenstat India, Mr. Sturle Pedersen Other distinguished dignitaries, ladies and gentlemen,  Good morning to all of you.  It is my privilege to deliver the inaugural address at the International Climate Summit - 2021 before this august audience.  I am delighted to see that this conference is bringing together leading policymakers, industrialists, investors, and scientists to discuss climate change and clean energy.  This Summit is taking place against the backdrop of a historic announcement by our beloved Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji on August 15.  In his address to the nation on the 75th Independence Day, he launched the Green Hydrogen Mission for India.  The fact that he chose &ldquo;Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav&rdquo; to make this announcement has sent a powerful message to both Indians and the rest of the world.  In my view, the message is two-fold:  One, India is determined to achieve azadi from dependence on fossil energy and become atma-nirbhar in New and Renewal Energy.  Two, India will make its fullest contribution to the global effort for achieving the goals and targets of Climate Action.  Dear Friends,  Climate Change is undoubtedly the most daunting challenge facing human civilisation today. The world is witnessing with alarming frequency the disastrous effects of global warming. Glaciers are retreating. Mean sea level is rising.  Extreme and unpredictable weather changes are becoming regular. Ecological damage is becoming stark. Indeed, Climate Change, if uncontrolled, can threaten the very existence of life on our planet. Therefore, it is not enough to make our economies carbon neutral. The world needs to achieve absolute reductions in emissions as soon as possible.  We have only one option: rapid transition to a new era of green, clean and renewable energy. Because Climate Change is a global problem, the clean energy transition calls for the widest possible global cooperation in technology development, investments and fair market access.  Ladies and gentlemen,   While this clean energy transition is a global imperative, it is important for India for another reason. Most of our present energy demand is met by imported fossil fuels costing us 160 billion USD every year.&nbsp; Although India&rsquo;s per capita energy consumption and emissions are less than half the global average, we are the world&rsquo;s third largest emitter of greenhouse gases.  India&rsquo;s energy needs will increase exponentially as our economic growth accelerates to fulfil the aspirations of 1.38 billion people. How do we increase our energy production while drastically reducing our carbon emission content?  Both India and the world are thus facing an unprecedented challenge. However, every challenge in human history has come with an opportunity to move to the next level of progress.  Dear Friends,  I am convinced that Climate Change is an opportunity for human civilisation to renew itself in the 21st century&hellip; An opportunity to create a healthier, happier, more secure and more resilient future for the human race&hellip;  A future in which there will be greater harmony between Man and Mother Nature. This opportunity for civilizational renewal will be realised by New and Renewable Energy. If Old Energy created the problem of Climate Change, New Energy will provide a reliable solution to Climate Mitigation.  As a matter of fact, a New GREEN REVOLUTION has already begun in India. The Old Green Revolution made India self-reliant in food production. The New Green Revolution will help make India self-sufficient in energy production.  It is a matter of great pride for all of us that India has now achieved a major milestone of 100 gigawatts installed renewable energy. India is today among the top three most attractive destinations for Renewable Energy.  The target of 175 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by December 2022 is now well within sight. &nbsp;The entire world will applaud India&rsquo;s singular achievement under the leadership of our Honourable Prime Minister.  Dear Friends,  I take this opportunity to share with you my perspectives on how India can become a global leader in Green Energy Revolution in the years to come. The Indian subcontinent is truly blessed by Soorya Deva, Vayu Deva and other gods with abundant renewable energy resources.&nbsp; Taking advantage of over 300 sunny days in a year, India can easily generate over 1,000 GW of solar energy on just 0.5% of our land.  Solar is perfectly suited to decentralised energy production, which in turn can promote decentralised socio-economic development. By investing in smart, two-way grids, micro-grids, efficient storage solutions and smart meters, we can enable individuals, communities and neighbourhoods to become both consumers and producers of energy.  These installations can be located close to demand. They have low maintenance requirements.&nbsp; Importantly, they have little environmental impact and entail zero human displacement problems. The rapid fall in the cost of production has made solar energy highly competitive, attracting large-scale investments.  This shall play a key role in ensuring similar growth trends in &ldquo;Green Hydrogen&rdquo; &ndash; the future replacement of fossil fuels. Green Hydrogen is a zero-carbon energy. It is the best and cleanest source of energy, which can play a fundamental role in the world&rsquo;s decarbonisation plans. Green hydrogen is key to our ever green, sustainable and prosperous future of everyone on the planet  Hydrogen has high gravimetric energy density and can be reconverted into electricity and heat with zero emissions. Although the costs of hydrogen from electrolysis today are high, they are expected to fall significantly in the coming years.  New technologies are emerging for hydrogen storage and transportation, which will dramatically reduce the cost of distribution. Furthermore, the Government of India is planning to create an enabling Green Hydrogen eco-system in the country. Because of all these developments, Green Hydrogen will surely attract significant investments.  Dear Friends,  Reliance Industries is fully committed to realising the vision of our Hon&rsquo;ble Prime Minister to fuel India&rsquo;s Green Economy using clean energy. Last year I had announced our ambitious commitment to make Reliance a net carbon zero company by 2035.  This year, I presented our strategy and roadmap for the New Energy Business, which will be the next big Value Creation Engine for Reliance and India. We have started developing the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex over 5,000 acres in Jamnagar.  It will be amongst the largest integrated renewable energy manufacturing facilities in the world. This complex will have four Giga Factories, which cover the entire spectrum of renewable energy. The first will be an integrated solar photovoltaic module factory. The second will be an advanced energy storage battery factory. &nbsp;The third will be an electrolyser factory for the production of Green Hydrogen.  The fourth will be a fuel cell factory for converting hydrogen into motive and stationary power. Over the next three years we will invest 75,000 crore rupees in these initiatives.&nbsp; Reliance will thus create and offer a fully integrated, end-to-end renewables energy ecosystem to India and Indians.  Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji has set the goal to reach 450GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030. Out of this, Reliance will establish and enable at least 100GW of solar energy by 2030.&nbsp; This will create a pan-India network of kilowatt and megawatt scale solar energy producers who can produce Green Hydrogen for local consumption.  This will bring enormous benefits and prosperity to rural India. Efforts are on globally to make Green Hydrogen most affordable fuel option by bringing down its cost to initially under USD 2 per kg.&nbsp; Let me assure you all that Reliance will aggressively pursue this target and achieve it well before the turn of this decade.  And India has always set and achieved even more audacious goals.&nbsp;&nbsp; Am sure that India can set even more aggressive target of achieving under USD 1 per kg within a decade. This will make India the first country globally to achieve $1 per 1 kilogram in 1 decade &ndash; the 1-1-1 target for Green Hydrogen.  India has achieved several goals that seemed impossible over the years. I am sure this 1-1-1 target for Green Hydrogen will also be achieved by our talented young entrepreneurs, researchers and innovators.  Respected Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji,  You are the architect of a New India. Your vision of New India is propelled by New and Renewable Energy. It will create millions of new and high-value green jobs for our youth. It will give a big boost to green enterprises in India, who can proudly proclaim: &ldquo;Made in India, by India, for India and for the world!&rdquo;.  It will transform India from a large Importer of Fossil Energy to a large Exporter of Clean Energy solutions. It will also bridge the green energy divide in India and globally. I am certain that, under your dynamic leadership, India will present to the world a template of a Green Economy Movement, which will truly be a People&rsquo;s Movement.  On behalf of all my colleagues in the Indian industry, on behalf of Reliance and on my own behalf, I pledge full support and commitment to your vision and mission.  Thank you.  &nbsp;Disclaimer:&nbsp;&nbsp;Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.
